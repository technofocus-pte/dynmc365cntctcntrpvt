# Lab 27 - Use Copilot to solve customer issues faster with Dynamics 365 Customer Service

**Introduction**  
In this lab, you will explore how Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer
Service enhances case management and customer communication. By using
Copilot to generate case summaries, you can quickly understand the
essential details of a case, allowing for faster and more informed
decision-making. Additionally, Copilot assists in drafting professional
and empathetic emails, ensuring consistent and effective customer
engagement. Together, these capabilities help service agents resolve
issues more efficiently while maintaining a high level of customer
satisfaction.

## Task 1: Summarize cases

Copilot case summaries help you to quickly understand the context of a
case and resolve customer issues more efficiently. The case summary
includes key information such as the case title, customer, subject,
product, priority, case type, and description.

      details from the customer to help resolve the problem.

      empathetic response to a customer who expresses a complaint.

    - **Provide product/service details**: Drafts a reply that offers
      details or answers customer questions about a particular product
      or service.

    - **Resolve the customer’s problem**: Drafts a reply that provides a
      resolution—and resolution steps, if applicable—to the customer’s
      problem.
