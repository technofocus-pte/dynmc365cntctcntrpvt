# Lab 14 - Configure the inbox setting for representatives 

### Introduction

In this lab, participants will learn how to configure inbox settings for
representatives in Copilot Service by editing the representatives
experience profile. The inbox provides a centralized workspace where
representatives can manage their cases, conversations, emails, and
voicemails more effectively. The lab begins with exploring the inbox
configuration options, such as enabling the inbox, reviewing closed work
item views, and adjusting record type visibility. Participants will then
configure a custom inbox view that consolidates different record types
into a single interface, enabling representatives to easily track and
manage their assigned work items.
