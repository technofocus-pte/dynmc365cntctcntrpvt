# Lab 4 - Manage personas and custom security roles in Dynamics 365 Contact Center

**Duration:** 10 mins

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to access and manage role persona
mapping in the Copilot Service admin center. Role persona mapping allows
administrators to assign or modify security roles for different
personas, such as agents, supervisors, or admins, to control access
levels and permissions within the system.

## Task 1: View and Edit Role Persona Mapping

In this task, you will navigate to the Role Persona Mapping section,
view available personas, and explore how to add or remove security
roles. Although no changes will be made in this lab, this task
demonstrates the process for managing persona-based security roles.
