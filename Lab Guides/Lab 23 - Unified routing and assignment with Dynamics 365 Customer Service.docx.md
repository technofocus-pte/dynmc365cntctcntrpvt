**Objective** - In this lab, you will use queues to organize, prioritize, and monitor the progress of your work.

    select **Queues**.

5.  The **Pick** dialog appears. For the **Also remove the item(s) from
    the Queue** dropdown, if you select **Yes,** the item is removed
    from the queue. For this scenario, select **No**.

6.  Select **Pick**. The item is assigned to you.

7.  If the item is in an advanced queue and is tracked through unified
    routing, the following actions occur:

    - The **Worked By** attribute of the queue item will be updated with
      your user ID. The unified routing system takes this as an
      indicator of work assignment.

    **Queue Item details** from the command menu.

9.  Select the lookup for the **Worked By** field and then select the
    user. If the queue item is assigned to a private queue, the lookup
    displays only the members of that queue.

**Note**

Remove the items from the queue can't be set for work items in an
advanced queue. Advanced queues are used in unified routing to which
work items are routed through workstreams.

## Task 2 - Release an item or case that you’re working on

1.  In the Customer Service workspace, select the **Site Map** and then
    select **Queues**.

## Task 6 - Add a case to a queue

If you think another group in your team has expertise on the subject,
you can move the case to a queue so that someone else can pick it up.

1.  In the Customer Service workspace, select the **Site Map** and then
    select **Cases**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/media23-new/image20.png)

2.  In the list of cases, select the case that you want to add to a
    queue.

3.  On the command bar, select **Add to Queue**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/media23-new/image21.png)

4.  In the **Queue** field, select the queue that you want to add the
    case to, and then select **Add**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/media23-new/image22.png)

If a case is already added to a queue, the **Queue** field displays the
current queue by default.

The lookup for the **Queue** field displays only the queues that are
configured for a specific entity. Voice and messaging queues aren't
displayed in the lookup results since cases can't be added to those
queues.

## Task 7 - Save and route a case

Save a case record and route it to a queue in a single action.

1.  From the list of cases, open a case record.

2.  Make any changes, and on the command bar, select **Save & Route**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/media23-new/image23.png)

The case will be routed based on the active routing rule set.

**Summary** - You have used queues to organize, prioritize, and monitor the progress of your work.
