# Lab 9 - Create and use Experience profiles

**Introduction**

In this lab, you will learn how to create and configure **Experience
Profiles** in the **Copilot Service Admin Center**. Experience Profiles
help organizations customize the agent experience by defining roles,
permissions, and productivity tools available to users.

You will perform tasks such as creating a new Experience Profile, adding
users, enabling productivity tools, and setting rank and roles to define
agent access and capabilities.

## Task 1 – Create an Experience Profile

In this task, you will create a new Experience Profile in the Copilot
Service Admin Center. This profile will define the settings and
characteristics of agents who will use the Copilot system.

**Conclusion**

In this lab, you learned how to create and configure an Experience
Profile in the Copilot Service Admin Center. You started by creating a
new profile called **Contoso Agent**, defining its name, description,
and unique identifier. Next, you assigned a user to the profile, granted
appropriate security roles, and enabled productivity tools to enhance
agent efficiency. Finally, you set the rank and roles to determine the
priority and access permissions associated with the profile. By
completing this lab, you gained a clear understanding of how Experience
Profiles help manage user access, define agent capabilities, and
streamline the overall support experience within the Copilot
environment.
