# Lab 27 - Use Copilot to solve customer issues faster with Dynamics 365 Customer Service

**Objective** - In this lab, you will use Copilot to summarize cases, draft email and questions.

## Task 1: Summarize cases

Copilot case summaries help you to quickly understand the context of a
case and resolve customer issues more efficiently. The case summary
includes key information such as the case title, customer, subject,
product, priority, case type, and description.

1. In the Copilot Service workspace, select the **Copilot Service Agent Dashboard**.

4.  When you start to draft an email, Copilot opens in the right-side  panel and presents five predefined prompts and one custom prompt:

    - **Suggest a call**: Drafts a reply that suggests a call with the
  customer today or tomorrow.

    - **Request more information**: Drafts a reply that requests more
  details from the customer to help resolve the problem.

    - **Empathize with feedback**: Drafts a reply that provides an
  empathetic response to a customer who expresses a complaint.

    - **Provide product/service details**: Drafts a reply that offers
  details or answers customer questions about a particular product or
  service.

    - **Resolve the customer's problem**: Drafts a reply that provides a
  resolution—and resolution steps, if applicable—to the customer's
  problem.

    - **Custom**: Allows you to provide your own prompt for the reply.
