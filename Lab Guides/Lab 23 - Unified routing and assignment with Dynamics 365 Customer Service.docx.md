7.  If the item is in an advanced queue and is tracked through unified
    routing, the following actions occur:

    - The **Worked By** attribute of the queue item will be updated with
      your user ID. The unified routing system takes this as an
      indicator of work assignment.

**Note**

Remove the items from the queue can't be set for work items in an
advanced queue. Advanced queues are used in unified routing to which
work items are routed through workstreams.

## Task 6 - Add a case to a queue

If you think another group in your team has expertise on the subject,
you can move the case to a queue so that someone else can pick it up.

If a case is already added to a queue, the **Queue** field displays the
current queue by default.

The lookup for the **Queue** field displays only the queues that are
configured for a specific entity. Voice and messaging queues aren't
displayed in the lookup results since cases can't be added to those
queues.

## Task 7 - Save and route a case

Save a case record and route it to a queue in a single action.

1.  From the list of cases, open a case record.
