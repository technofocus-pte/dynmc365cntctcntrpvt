5.  In the **Update rules for suggesting contacts** section on the **Case** record, reorder or
    disable the rules for suggesting contacts. Users see the suggestions
    in the order we choose.

    - To reorder the rules, hover over a rule, and then select the up or
      down arrow to move the rules up or down, respectively.

    - To disable a rule, hover over a rule, and then
      select ![](./media/media21/image5.png) . When the rule is disabled, a
      check mark is displayed when you hover over the disabled rule.

    - To delete a rule, hover over the rule, and then
      select ![](./media/media21/image6.png) . Deleting a rule removes it
      entirely so it won't influence suggested contacts in the future.
