# Lab 25 - Resolve, cancel, reassign and merge cases

### Introduction

In this lab, you will explore the different ways to manage cases in
Dynamics 365 Customer Service through the Copilot Service workspace. You
will learn how to resolve cases by providing closure details, cancel
cases when they are no longer valid, and reassign cases to other users
or teams when collaboration is required. Additionally, the lab covers
merging cases to consolidate duplicate or related issues into a single
record for better case management. These tasks are essential for
ensuring accuracy, reducing duplication, and maintaining efficient
customer service operations.

**Conclusion**

By completing this lab, you gained practical experience in handling
various case lifecycle activities such as resolving, canceling,
reassigning, and merging cases in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. These
actions ensure that cases are properly tracked, efficiently managed, and
accurately assigned to the right resources. The ability to merge related
or duplicate cases also streamlines case management and prevents
redundancy. Overall, this lab highlights how structured case handling
supports better organization, improves agent productivity, and enhances
the quality of customer service delivery.
