# Lab 12 - Configure routing based on external schedules

### Introduction

In this lab, participants will learn how to configure routing based on
external schedules by enabling Workforce Management and setting up
shift-based routing in Copilot Service. Workforce Management ensures
that customer service operations align with representative availability,
while shift-based routing allows cases to be assigned to representative
according to their scheduled working hours. By completing the exercises,
participants will gain practical experience in installing and enabling
Workforce Management, as well as configuring shift-based routing to
optimize workload distribution and improve service efficiency.
